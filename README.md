  - **Visual Inventory Tracking**: Uses **YOLOv8** for object detection and **Custom CNN Model** for classifying fresh/spoiled ingredients and done stock prediction.
  - **Food Spoilage Detection**: Combines **YOLO** and **Custom CNN Model** for detecting spoiled food items.

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Demand & Waste Prediction**
  - **Sales Forecasting**:
    - **Long-Term Trends**: **Prophet model** forecasts sales using seasonality.
    - **Short-Term Adjustments**: **XGBoost model** predicts based on past sales & pricing factors.
    - **Final Prediction**: Weighted combination (**70% Prophet, 30% XGBoost**).
  - **Historical Comparison**:
    - Extracts past sales data for the same date (2010-2024) and compares predicted vs. historical ingredient consumption.
  - **Waste Prediction**:
    - Calculates daily waste levels based on sales and stock data.
    - **Predicting High-Waste Dishes**: Linear Regression identifies dishes contributing most to waste.
    - **Ingredient-Specific Waste Analysis**: Ranks ingredients by predicted waste for optimized procurement planning.
  - **Dynamic Inventory Replenishment**:
    - Analyzes waste trends to rank high-risk dishes & ingredients.
    - Predicts ingredient consumption based on sales and recipes.
    - Applies buffer stock (5-15%) for volatile ingredients.
    - Uses **Google Gemini AI** for dynamic stock optimization.

- 🍜 **Intelligent Menu Optimization**
  - **AI-Driven Recipe Recommendations**: Utilizes **historical consumption, waste predictions, and restaurant-specific data**.
  - **Cost Optimization**: Suggests **nearly spoiled ingredients** usage via **Gemini AI**.
  - **Custom Dish Creation**: Generates new dish ideas using **Gemini API**, considering **previous day's waste prediction** and **sales data** to create sustainable and optimized menu items.


- 📊 **Vision-Powered Waste Analysis & Reporting**
  - **Food Waste Classification**: Uses **YOLO** for waste identification.
  - **Waste Heatmap** (Future Work)
  - **Loss-to-Profit Dashboard**:
    - Computes **wastage (stock - sales units)**.
    - Calculates **profit (total revenue - total cost)**.
    - Visualizes financial impact through **charts & dashboards**.
    - Enables data-driven decision-making to **reduce waste & maximize profit**.
